## Coursera Developing Data Products course project.

My shiny application with examples of using :
- some form of input
- operation like predictive with random forest in server.R
- reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations

Here link on shiny app - https://gravialex.shinyapps.io/Iris_predict/
I use predictive modeling ( Random Forest ) to predict Species value for new data.

Also we can see values from trainind data set IRIS with our inputed value ( green point ) on the chart.
